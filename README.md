# Thought experiment: decoding cognitive processes from the fMRI data of one individual

Code for the analyses in our fMRI mind-reading study

This is work in progress.  

### Abstract
Cognitive processes, such as the generation of language, can be mapped onto the brain using fMRI. The brain maps in turn can be used for decoding the mental operations that accompanied the respective activation patterns. Given the individual variations in brain anatomy and organization, analyses on the level of individual persons are important to better understand the functional mapping of mental functions. Focusing on the individual also allows to advance clinical application of fMRI, where diagnosis of the single case is the goal.
In the present study, we used mental imagery tasks to investigate language production, motor functions, visuo-spatial memory, face processing, and resting-state activity in a single person. The fMRI data were split into training and test sets, and four teams of researchers competed to decode the test data. Predictions were made regarding the cognitive domain (e.g. “language”) and the specific content (e.g. “animal names”) of single 30-second blocks. Analysis methods were based on similarity metrics, including correlations between training and test data, as well as correlations with maps from the NeuroSynth meta-analysis.
Results showed that 23 of the 25 test blocks could be correctly predicted by three of the four teams. A similarity metric based on correlations and a winner-take-all decision mechanism allowed to reach the highest degrees of accuracy. Excluding the unspecific rest condition, up to 10 out of 20 blocks could be successfully decoded regarding their specific content.
The study shows how the information contained in a single fMRI session can allow to draw inferences about an individual's momentary mental states. Simple methods like correlations can serve as highly reliable approaches for cognitive decoding. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of clinical fMRI applications, with a focus on how decoding can support functional localization.
